# Great-Indian-Hackathon-by-Machine-Hack-Rank-9th
This repository is saved to display my approach for Great Indian Hiring Hackathon organized by Machine-Hack. In which I have Ranked 3RD out of 5000+ entries all over India.

I have shared each approach which I had implemented within the course of 22 days of hackathon, right from EDA processes which include dealing with outliers, feature engineering, feature extraction, to dealing with selection of appropriate model and hyperparameter tuning the modek as per the data and evaluating the model using effective RMSE Score, considering bais and variance trade-off, with a target to achieve the most generalized model, which would work well on unseen data as well.
